### Test task - kettle.
<p>Main idea - kettle behavior imitation.</p>
<p>The entire interface realised in console.</p>

After starting program you can:
  1. pour water into the kettle
  2. make decision about turn on the kettle
  3. boil the kettle

<p>Added logging at main.log and config file (setup.ini) where you can choose kettle settings.<p>
